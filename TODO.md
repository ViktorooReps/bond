# Runner
Move `run_experiment.py` to PyPI. Make it use all the available GPUs efficiently (at least memory-wise). Move memory requirements to configs.  

DONE

Add pausing and resuming experiments.

# Docker
Pulling source code from git + environment preparation.

# New baseline
Create new repository with fixes and dataset + create polished docker environment for it.

# Documentation
Add instructions on how to use docker files: create images and containers.
